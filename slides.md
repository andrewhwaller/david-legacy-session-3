<!--
* The Dura-Europos synagogue consistutes of of the oldest known examples of Jewish art.
  * One striking thing about this depiction of David is that he is portrayed as an essentially Greek or Roman figure.
  * This David takes the form of a beardless Hellenistic youth and is anointed by a toga-wearing Samuel.
* The depiction in the synagogue is joined by a nearby third century Christian church, which also features depictions of David, notably his battle with Goliath.
  * For more on this, see [Michael Peppard](https://www.ancientjewreview.com/read/2016/4/18/david-as-warrior-at-dura-europos).

<!--
* This portrayal utilizes the atheletic ideal of the Renaissance-era revival of the *classical* ideal.
* David is dragged through time into a 16th century appropriation of a 5th century BC Greek ideal.
* This particular work has become, in turn, an exemplar of that Renaissance appropriation.

# A diversity of Davids... so what?

<!--
* There are a few pitfalls that we encounter when trying understand David.
* First, there is the temptation to turn David into a moral exemplar.
  * That is, we take the idea that David is a "man after God's own heart" and then find ways to ignore or excuse the problems that go along with David's story.
  * For the Mark Driscolls of the world, David becomes a model of masculinity, the prototypical warrior-king. Or, better yet, a warrior-poet, or perhaps even a warrior-pastor.
  * While there may be some good that can come of considering David in these terms, treating David as a sort of King Arthur figure or romanticizing his story will not serve us well.
* Second, there is a related temptation to solely focus on David's flaws.
  * This preaches very well!
  * David was Israel's great king, but he failed in myriad ways, therefore we need a better king, i.e., Jesus.
    * This turns David's story into one massive Jesus-juke: David was really messed up, but Jesus is our perfect king.
  * Again, while there is some truth here, this is plainly not the way that, for example, the New Testament authors talk about David.
    * No one in the NT says, "David was a garbage king, but Jesus is the real deal."
* Third, we can psychologize David.
  * David's latent presence in the Psalms prompts various levels of psychological analysis of David's character, his emotions, and his interior life.
  * These perspectives on David are almost entirely conjecture and don't ultimately craft a reliable portrait of David as a person.
    * While from a canonical perspective, the Davidic superscriptions are a helpful guide for situating some of the Psalms, they are not a reliable source for understanding David's life.
    * We will address the David of the Psalms more in a future session.

# Whose story is David participating in?

# Deut 17:14--20
When you have come into the land that the <sc>Lord</sc> your God is giving you, and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, “I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me,” you may indeed set over you a king whom the <sc>Lord</sc> your God will choose.
One of your own community you may set as king over you; you are not permitted to put a foreigner over you, who is not of your own community.
Even so, he must not acquire many horses for himself, or return the people to Egypt in order to acquire more horses, since the <sc>Lord</sc> has said to you, “You must never return that way again.”
And he must not acquire many wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away; also silver and gold he must not acquire in great quantity for himself.
When he has taken the throne of his kingdom, he shall have a copy of this law written for him in the presence of the levitical priests.
It shall remain with him and he shall read in it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the <sc></sc> his God, diligently observing all the words of this law and these statutes, neither exalting himself above other members of the community nor turning aside from the commandment, either to the right or to the left, so that he and his descendants may reign long over his kingdom in Israel.

# Judges 8:22--28
Then the Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also; for you have delivered us out of the hand of Midian.”
Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the <sc>Lord</sc> will rule over you.”
Then Gideon said to them, “Let me make a request of you; each of you give me an earring he has taken as \[spoil\].”...
“We will willingly give them,” they answered. So they spread a garment, and each threw into it an earring he had taken as \[spoil\].
The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold\.\.\.\.
Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his town, in Ophrah; and all Israel prostituted themselves to it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family.
So Midian was subdued before the Israelites, and they lifted up their heads no more. So the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.

# Judges 9:1--6
Now Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother’s kinsfolk and said to them and to the whole clan of his mother’s family, “Say in the hearing of all the lords of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal rule over you, or that one rule over you?’ Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.”
So his mother’s kinsfolk spoke all these words on his behalf in the hearing of all the lords of Shechem; and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother.”
They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the temple of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, who followed him.
He went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone; but Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, for he hid himself.
Then all the lords of Shechem and all Beth-millo came together, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar at Shechem.

<!--
* Abimelech is not chosen by God, but he is Israel's first king.
* The referain throughout Judges that "there was no king in Israel" now takes on a different implication: there is a king in Israel, but he is not the king that will obey Deuteronomy 17.
  * Both literally and figuratively, this king is lawless.
  * Abimelech's attempt to set up a generational dynasty ends in disaster. He orders his armor-bearer to kill him (Judges 9:54), just as Saul will do (1 Sam 31:4). Saul's armor-bearer will refuse, but Abimelech's will not.

# 1 Samuel 13:13--14
Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the <sc>Lord</sc> your God, which he commanded you.
The <sc>Lord</sc> would have established your kingdom over Israel forever, but now your kingdom will not continue; the <sc>Lord</sc> has sought out a man after his own heart; and the <sc>Lord</sc> has appointed him to be ruler over his people, because you have not kept what the <sc>Lord</sc> commanded you.”

<!--
* Notably, there's a separation between Israel's monarchy and the worship of God, i.e., the king is not in charge of cult.
  * While the boundaries between priest and prophet get blurry at times, the sons of Aaron are the priests, not Moses or Israel's future kings.
  * Moses's sons take roles as Levites, subordinate to the sons of Aaron.
    * Likewise, the king is not a cultic leader.
  * Saul's downfall is marked by his usurpation of cult, just like Gideon and Abimelech.
    * Whereas Gideon imitates the Golden Calf incident, Saul does something somewhat more subtle. While this is not the worship of an image, it is still unlawful cult and therefore a violation of the law.

# 1 Samuel 16:6--13
When \[the sons of Jesse\] came, \[Samuel\] looked on Eliab and thought, “Surely the <sc>Lord</sc>’s anointed is now before the <sc>Lord</sc>.”
But the <sc>Lord</sc> said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the <sc>Lord</sc> does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the <sc>Lord</sc> looks on the heart.”
Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel\.\.\.\.
Then Jesse made Shammah pass by\.\.\.\.
Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, “The <sc>Lord</sc> has not chosen any of these.”
Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, but he is keeping the sheep.”
And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.”
He sent and brought him in.
Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome.
The <sc>Lord</sc> said, “Rise and anoint him; for this is the one.”
Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the <sc>Lord</sc> came mightily upon <span v-mark="{ color: '#f72f47', type: 'circle', strokeWidth: 5 }">David</span> from that day forward.
Samuel then set out and went to Ramah.
Now the spirit of the <sc>Lord</sc> departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the <sc>Lord</sc> tormented him.

# 1 Samuel 16:17--23
So Saul said to his servants, “Provide for me someone who can play well, and bring him to me.”
One of the young men answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing, a man of valor, a warrior, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence; and the <sc>Lord</sc> is with him.”
So Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me your son David who is with the sheep.” ...
And David came to Saul, and entered his service. Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.

# 1 Samuel 17:55--58
When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?”
Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.” ...
On David’s return from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”

<!--
* It seems like there may be two introductions to David that are being spliced together.
  * David has an origin story as the anointed replacement for Saul who then enters Saul's court as a Spirit-empowered musician.
  * David then has a second introduction as a warrior who defeats Goliath (1 Sam 17:12--18).
* When David comes before Saul to volunteer to fight Goliath, David's parentage is not discussed; thus, it is reasonable for Saul to ask who David is after the fact.
* Nevertheless, as things stand in the canonical text, David is introduced to Saul twice.
  * David's defeat of Goliath renders him unrecognizable to Saul.
    * David's previous characterization as a shepherd is quickly replaced by a new characterization as the slayer of thousands.
    * This sets the stage for the story of David's rise and his conflict with Saul.

# The story of Israel's monarchy does not begin or end with David.

<!--
* The larger context of the Deuteronomistic History places David on a stage with Moses, the judges of Israel, and the armies of the nations.
* David has almost no identity or characterization outside of this larger story.
  * Any unique identity is denied to him: he is not David, the plucky son of Jesse, but the anointed successor to Saul the law-breaker (who happens to be David, son of Jesse).
  * Saul is given comparatively extensive characterization, but David is not.
